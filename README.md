The project, titled "Flashcard-o-matic," is a web application aimed at aiding students in online studying. It offers features for both teachers and students. Teachers can create decks of flashcards for various subjects, while students can study these decks. The project is built using React and includes several screens: Home (with options to create, study, view, or delete decks), Study (for studying a deck's flashcards), Create Deck (to create a new deck), Deck (displays deck information and allows editing and card management), Edit Deck (for modifying existing decks), Add Card (to add new flashcards to a deck), and Edit Card (for editing existing flashcards). The project uses two datasets, decks, and cards, and provides utility functions for API operations. The project emphasizes good coding practices and offers a comprehensive set of requirements for each screen's functionality.
